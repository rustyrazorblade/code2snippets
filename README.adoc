# code2snippets

code2snippets is a small utility I wrote to help with blogging.  I generally have a handful of codesnippets I want to show, but when I'm writing I'm usually making changes, and

## Installing

For now, grab the repo and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rustyrazorblade/code2snippets.git
cd code2snippets
./gradlew distTar
```

## Usage

In your source code, you'll want to tag blocks of code using single line comments and a basic marker syntax:

For example, if we have this code:

```kotlin
// :demo
init {
    val delim = types.getOrElse(extension) {
        throw UnsupportedTypeException("Extention $extension not supported, how did you even get here?")
    }
    // spaces, comment, spaces, :marker spaces
    regex = """\s*${delim.s}\s+:([a-z][a-z0-9]*)\s*""".toRegex()
}
// :demo
```

the utility will extract the lines between the comments, and write a `demo.snippet` file with the contents.  To run the tool:

```bash
code2snippets /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```
